# CryptoClustering

This project applies Python and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze how cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour and 7-day price changes. By clustering the data, we aim to identify patterns and group similar cryptocurrencies.

The project involves:

    1. Data preparation and normalization.

    2. Finding the optimal number of clusters (using the Elbow Method)

    3. Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means.

    4. Dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for optimization.

    5. Comparing clustering results with and without PCA.
